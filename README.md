# ID3 Algorithm

## Dataset Description:

For this, we will use the mushroom data set provided with this problem set. The data has been divided into two pieces mush_train.data and mush_test.data. These data sets were generated using the UCI Mushroom data set (follow the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom for information about the format of the data). Note that the class label is the first column in the data set.

## Problem Description:

The objective is to train a decision tree using the information gain heuristic to select attributes (break ties using a majority vote). Also we must calculate the accuracy of the learned decision tree on the training set as well as on the test set.


# AdaBoost Algorithm

## Dataset Description:

For this, we will use the data set provided with this problem set. The data has been divided into two pieces heart_train.data and heart_test.data. These data sets were generated using the UCI SPECT heart data set (follow the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SPECT+Heart for information about the format of the data). Note that the class label is the first column in the data set.

## Problem Description:

Suppose that the hypothesis space consists only of depth 2 decision trees for this data set, our objective is to run the AdaBoost algorithm with M = 4 to train a classifier for this data set. Also report how the accuracy of the AdaBoost classifier change with different values of M. For instance, M âˆˆ {8, 16, 32, 64}.
